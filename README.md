# Restaurant-API

A simple Restaurant-API made with Java 11 + SpringBoot to practice. I've been following the book Learning Java: An Introduction to Real-World Programming with Java from Marc Loy, along with SpringBoot: Up and Running from Mark Heckler.

To store the data i've used In-memory repository with Spring Data KeyValue.
